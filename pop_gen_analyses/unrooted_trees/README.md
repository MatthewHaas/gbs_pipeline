# README for unrooted_trees

The script [gl2gi.R](gl2gi.R) script is here because I coud not get the [dartR](https://rdrr.io/cran/dartR/src/R/gl2gi.r) package installed and I needed the function. Fortunately, I was able to find the source code, so I saved the function as its own file and call it using ```source()``` in my scripts to make the unrooted trees. The script is important because it converts the genlight object (which I have) to a genind object (which I need).
