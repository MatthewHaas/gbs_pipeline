# README (imputation)

## The contents of this directory are for using BEAGLE to impute missing SNPs into the GBS data set for characterizing genetic diversity in _Zizania palustris_.

### impute_with_beagle.sh
This script was used to use BEAGLE to impute SNPs.
As of 29 January 2020, I am still practicing and getting to know how to use BEAGLE, so this is not the final version.

### setup_directory_for_imputation.txt
This is how the directory where I carried out the imputation steps was set up.
